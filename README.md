I am currently, and continuously, dedicated to learning new skills to help further my advancement in the field of technology.
I have a culmination of experience from years in various roles that all were founded in the service of others, from hospitality positions to over a decade in the armed forces. Whether it be leading soldiers, employees, or most recently, assisting the communities with the pandemic, I have always taken pride in the ability to help others. 
I strive to always bring professionalism, integrity and my willingness to drive others, so that any team I am collaborating with will excel in its endeavors.
